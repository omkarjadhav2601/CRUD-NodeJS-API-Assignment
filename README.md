CRUD API in Node JS, Express JS, and Mongo DB.

Hi Everyone,

This is my first project in Node JS with Mongo DB - With this project, you will be able to perform basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) API Operations in Mongo DB using POSTMAN.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Install below listed necessary packages using npm command for your project: "body-parser": "^1.19.0", "dateformat": "^4.5.1", "dotenv": "^8.2.0", "express": "^4.17.1", "mongoose": "^5.12.1", "nodemon": "^2.0.7", "winston": "^3.3.3" "eslint": "^7.23.0"

Install Visual Studio Code for better handling and working on the files with helpful extensions like git bash, eslint, console, etc. Install Postman to send CRUD requests and get a response for the same.

I have used Winston for logging and everything is logged inside the app.log file with formatting as per the request and response.
